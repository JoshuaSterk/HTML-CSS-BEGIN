      <p> 
        The white bear, more commonly known as the polar bear, is the largest, heaviest and strongest of all bears.
        The polar bear is a carnivore. It mainly feeds on the fat of seals, but also eats carcasses of stranded belugas, whales and walruses.
        They are smart, fast and very strong. A polar bear is very big.
        When a male polar bear stands on its hind legs, it is about the size of an elephant. Female polar bears are smaller.
